# TODOs

## âœ… Completed

### File Naming Convention Improvements
- [x] Use the markdown header content from source files as the primary file name when available
- [x] For files containing only Mermaid code:
  - Use abbreviated prefixes to indicate diagram type:
    - seq_ for sequence diagrams
    - graph_ for flowcharts/graphs
    - class_ for class diagrams
    - etc.
  - Follow with a descriptive name based on content
  - Example: "seq_user_authentication.md" instead of "diagrams_0_sequence"
